# Data Visualization Guidelines
by Luis Ahumada Abrigo & Guillermina Sutter Schneider

This stylebook marks the beginning of a new phase in data visualization at the [Cato Institute](http://www.cato.org) . It is meant to improve the quality of data visualization in order to create a more appealing experience for the reader and to more effectively communicate Cato’s mission and message to the public. 

You will find graphic guidelines for each figure and table as well as the justification for each one’s design. Simplifying visuals, sometimes with less information, can make communication clearer and more effective. Every figure and table is important and can have a significant impact on the distribution of the research. Each figure is an opportunity to communicate a greater message with fewer words.
